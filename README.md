**Project: E-Commerce Application Backend**

**Technologies Used:** Core Java, Collections Framework, HashMap,

OOPs, Exception Handling, Generics

**Description:**

Designed and developed a backend system for an eCommerce

application to manage products using Core Java and Data Structures.

The application performs CRUD operations on various product

categories like Shirts, T-Shirts, Mobiles, Laptops, etc., using a

HashMap (ProductId → Product) for efficient data retrieval and

management.

Key Features & Implementations:

✔ Product Management: Performed CRUD operations (Create, Read,

Update, Delete) on different product types.

✔ Category & Filtering: Retrieved and filtered products based on

category, subcategory, brand, size, and price.

✔ Instanceof for Type-Specific Queries: Used instanceof to filter

specific product types (Shirts, Mobiles, T-Shirts, etc.).

✔ Product Counting & Aggregation: Counted products based on

type, brand, size, and color.

✔ Sorting Mechanism: Implemented sorting for products based on

price (Low to High / High to Low).

✔ Listing & Statistics:

• Fetched all available brands, sizes, and categories.

• Counted total product categories and subcategories.

✔ User-Specific Queries: Allowed users to input search criteria

to fetch and count products dynamically.

✔ Product Removal & Maintenance: Enabled deletion of

products using ProductId for efficient inventory management.

This project showcases efficient data management using Collections,

and practical implementation of Object-Oriented Programming

concepts in Java.

**Version-II:**

**Project:** E-Commerce Application Backend

Technologies Used: Core Java, Collections (HashMap), OOPs, Exception

Handling, Generics

**Description:**

Developed a backend system for an E-Commerce application to manage

products efficiently using HashMap (ProductId → Product) for CRUD

operations. Implemented category-based filtering, sorting (price low-to-

high/high-to-low), and product aggregation using Core Java and Data

Structures.

Key Features:

✔ CRUD operations on various product types (Shirts, Mobiles, Laptops, etc.)

✔ Product filtering using instanceof for type-based retrieval

✔ Sorting products based on price (ascending & descending)

✔ Aggregated product counts by category, brand, size, and color

✔ Efficient product retrieval and removal using ProductId

This project demonstrates data handling, optimized search, and structured

inventory management using Java Collections.
