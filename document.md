&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Project: E-Commerce Application BackendTechnologies Used: Core Java, Collections Framework, HashMap,

OOPs, Exception Handling, Generics

Description:

Designed and developed a backend system for an eCommerce

application to manage products using Core Java and Data
Structures.

The application performs CRUD operations on various product

categories like Shirts, T-Shirts, Mobiles, Laptops, etc., using a

&nbsp;

HashMap (ProductId → Product) for efficient data retrieval and

management.

Key Features &amp; Implementations:

✔ Product Management: Performed CRUD
operations (Create, Read,

Update, Delete) on different product types.

✔ Category &amp; Filtering: Retrieved
and filtered products based on

category, subcategory, brand, size, and price.

✔ Instanceof for Type-Specific Queries:
Used instanceof to filter

specific product types (Shirts, Mobiles, T-Shirts, etc.).

✔ Product Counting &amp; Aggregation:
Counted products based on

type, brand, size, and color.

✔ Sorting Mechanism: Implemented
sorting for products based on

price (Low to High / High to Low).

✔ Listing &amp; Statistics:

• Fetched all available brands, sizes, and categories.

• Counted total product categories and subcategories.

✔ User-Specific Queries: Allowed users
to input search criteria

to fetch and count products dynamically.

✔ Product Removal &amp; Maintenance:
Enabled deletion of

products using ProductId for efficient inventory management.

This project showcases efficient data management using
Collections,

and practical implementation of Object-Oriented Programming

concepts in Java.

Version-II:

&nbsp;

Project: E-Commerce Application Backend

Technologies Used: Core Java, Collections (HashMap), OOPs,
Exception

Handling, Generics

&nbsp;

Description:

Developed a backend system for an E-Commerce application to manage

products efficiently using HashMap (ProductId → Product) for CRUD

&nbsp;

operations. Implemented category-based filtering, sorting (price
low-to-

high/high-to-low), and product aggregation using Core Java and
Data

&nbsp;

Structures.

Key Features:

✔ CRUD operations on various product
types (Shirts, Mobiles, Laptops, etc.)

✔ Product filtering using instanceof
for type-based retrieval

✔ Sorting products based on price
(ascending &amp; descending)

✔ Aggregated product counts by
category, brand, size, and color

✔ Efficient product retrieval and
removal using ProductId

This project demonstrates data handling, optimized search, and
structured

inventory management using Java Collections.
